# Road-lane-Detection
This project detects lane lines in road images or video frames using classical computer vision techniques in OpenCV. It's a beginner-friendly implementation that demonstrates how edge detection and Hough transforms can be applied for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Features
Detects left and right lane lines in images or videos

Uses Canny Edge Detection for feature extraction

Applies Hough Line Transform for line detection

Includes optional Streamlit app for interactive visualization

Fully compatible with Google Colab for fast testing

üß† Techniques Used
Grayscale and Gaussian Blur preprocessing

Canny Edge Detection

Region of Interest Masking

Hough Transform Line Detection

Slope Averaging for Line Smoothing
